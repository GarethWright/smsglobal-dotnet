    Install-Package SMSGlobal

### With .NET Core Command Line Tools

If you are building with the .NET Core command line tools, then you can run the following command from within your project directory:

    dotnet add package SMSGlobal
    
### Azure functions

From within Visual Studio while creating azure function app, you can use the NuGet GUI to search for and install the SMSGlobal NuGet package. Or, as a shortcut, simply type the following command into the Package Manager Console:

    Install-Package SMSGlobal
    
More information can be found here. [Nuget Client Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools)

## Configuration

First import the package by using SMSGlobal api:

```csharp
using SMSGlobal.api;
```
To setup the configuration of the SMSGlobal client you have to create following object with Rest and Secret API keys.

```csharp
var client = new Client(new Credentials("SMSGLOBAL-API-KEY", "SMSGLOBAL-SECRET-KEY"));
```
And then consume the function like this:

```csharp
var response = await client.SMS.SMSSend(new
{
    origin = "Test",
    destination = "DESTINATION-NUMBER",
    message = "This is a test message"
});
```
The response object will contain the result object and also two keys fields:

1. statuscode: This code can be used to determine the outcome of the call. Based on data passed you can get different status codes such as 400, 404, 200 etc.

2. statusmessages: This message can be used to determine the outcome of the call. Each status code has a status message linked. 

Each api call have different status codes and messages, more info about status codes can be found here. [Rest API](https://www.smsglobal.com/rest-api/?utm_source=dev&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=dotnet_sdk)

### Sending a Message

This can be used to send a single message.

```csharp
var client = new Client(new Credentials("SMSGLOBAL-API-KEY", "SMSGLOBAL-SECRET-KEY"));

var response = await client.SMS.SMSSend(new
{
    origin = "Test",
    destination = "DESTINATION-NUMBER",
    message = "This is a test message"
});
```

This can be used to send a multiple messages.

```csharp

Object[] messages = new Object[2];

messages[0] = new {
origin = "Test",
destination = "DESTINATION-NUMBER-1",
message = "This is a test message"
};

messages[1] = new {
origin = "Test",
destination = "DESTINATION-NUMBER-2",
message = "This is a test message"
};

var response = await client.SMS.SMSSend(new { messages = messages });
			
```
The response object will contain collection of outgoing message objects.

This can be used to send to multiple destinations.

```csharp
string[] destinations = new string[2];

destinations[0] = "DESTINATION-NUMBER-1";
destinations[1] = "DESTINATION-NUMBER-2";

var response = await client.SMS.SMSSend(new
{
   origin = "Test",
   destinations = destinations,
   message = "This is a test message"
});
```
The response object will contain collection of outgoing message objects.

Same way we can send mutiple messages of array having multiple destinations array in it.

```csharp

Object[] messages = new Object[2];

string[] destinations1 = new string[2];

destinations[0] = "DESTINATION-NUMBER-1";
destinations[1] = "DESTINATION-NUMBER-2";

string[] destinations2 = new string[2];

destinations[0] = "DESTINATION-NUMBER-3";
destinations[1] = "DESTINATION-NUMBER-4";

messages[0] = new {
origin = "Test",
destinations = destinations1,
message = "This is a test message"
};

messages[1] = new {
origin = "Test",
destinations = destinations2,
message = "This is a test message"
};

var response = await client.SMS.SMSSend(new { messages = messages });

```
The response object will contain collection of outgoing message objects.

### Receive all Messages

This can be used to view list of all outgoing messages. The messages returned can be filtered based on different condition.

```csharp
var client = new Client(new Credentials("SMSGLOBAL-API-KEY", "SMSGLOBAL-SECRET-KEY"));

string filter = "limit=1";
var response = await client.SMS.SMSGetAll(filter);
```
The response object will contain all the sms sent messages objects.

### Get Message By Id

This can be used to view details of an outgoing message.

```csharp
var client = new Client(new Credentials("SMSGLOBAL-API-KEY", "SMSGLOBAL-SECRET-KEY"));

string id = "SMSGLOBAL-OUTGOING-ID";
var response = await client.SMS.SMSGetId(id);
```
The response object will contain details of the message.

### Delete Message

This can be used to delete outgoing message.

```csharp
var client = new Client(new Credentials("SMSGLOBAL-API-KEY", "SMSGLOBAL-SECRET-KEY"));

string id = "SMSGLOBAL-OUTGOING-ID";
var response = await client.SMS.SMSDeleteId(id);
```
The reponse of this request will return status code where 204 means message deleted successfully.

### Get All Incoming Messages

This can be used to get all incoming messages. The messages returned can be filtered based on different condition.

```csharp
var client = new Client(new Credentials("SMSGLOBAL-API-KEY", "SMSGLOBAL-SECRET-KEY"));

 string filter = "limit=1";
 var response = await client.SMS.SMSGetIncoming(filter);
```
The response object will contain all the incoming messages objects.

### Get Incoming Message By Id

This can be used to view details of an incoming message.

```csharp
var client = new Client(new Credentials("SMSGLOBAL-API-KEY", "SMSGLOBAL-SECRET-KEY"));

string id = "INCOMING-NUMBER";
var response = await client.SMS.SMSDeleteIncoming(id);
```
The response object will contain details of the incoming message.

### Delete Incoming Message

This can be used to delete an incoming message.

```csharp
var client = new Client(new Credentials("SMSGLOBAL-API-KEY", "SMSGLOBAL-SECRET-KEY"));

string id = "SMSGLOBAL-OUTGOING-ID";
var response = await client.SMS.SMSGetIncomingById(id);
```
The reponse of this request will return status code where 204 means message deleted successfully.

### Get All Opted Out Numbers

This can be used to get all opted out numbers. The numbers returned can be filtered based on different condition.

```csharp
var client = new Client(new Credentials("SMSGLOBAL-API-KEY", "SMSGLOBAL-SECRET-KEY"));

string filter = "";
var response = await client.SMS.SMSGetOptOuts(filter);
```
The response object will contain all the opted number objects.

### Opt Out Number

This can be used to opt out numbers.

```csharp
var client = new Client(new Credentials("SMSGLOBAL-API-KEY", "SMSGLOBAL-SECRET-KEY"));

Object[] payload = new Object[2];
payload[0] = new
{
    number = "MOBILE-NUMBER"
};
payload[1] = new
{
    number = "MOBILE-NUMBER"
};

var response = await client.SMS.SMSPostOptOut(new { optouts = payload });
```
The response object will contain collection of Opt out number object. Optout object consist of number and status(exist, valid, and invalid) properties.

### Validate Opt Out

This can be used to validate mobile numbers for opt-out.

```csharp
var client = new Client(new Credentials("SMSGLOBAL-API-KEY", "SMSGLOBAL-SECRET-KEY"));

Object[] payload = new Object[2];
payload[0] = new
{
    number = "MOBILE-NUMBER"
};
payload[1] = new
{
    number = "MOBILE-NUMBER"
};

var response = await client.SMS.SMSPostOptOutValidate(new { optouts = payload });
```
The response object will contain collection of Opt out number object. Optout object consist of number and status(exist, valid, and invalid) properties.

### Opt In Number

This can be used to opt in a number.

```csharp
var client = new Client(new Credentials("SMSGLOBAL-API-KEY", "SMSGLOBAL-SECRET-KEY"));

string number = "MOBILE-NUMBER";
var response = await client.SMS.SMSDeleteOptOut(number);
```
The reponse of this request will return status code where 204 means opted-in successfully.
